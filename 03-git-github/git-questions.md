## 1. What is Git? Why do we use it?
Git is Version Control System Tool that helps to track our changes in code.</br>
“Suppose I am working on an application and I update a file called app.py.</br>
With Git, I can save this change using a commit.</br>
If my change causes an issue later, I can easily go back to the previous working version.</br>
Git also allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s code.”
