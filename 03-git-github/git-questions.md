## 1. What is Git? Why do we use it?
Git is Version Control System Tool that helps to track our changes in code.</br>

- Example:</br>
“Suppose I am working on an application and I update a file called app.py.</br>
With Git, I can save this change using a commit.</br>
If my change causes an issue later, I can easily go back to the previous working version.</br>
Git also allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s code.”

## 2. Difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a version control tool, while GitHub is a cloud platform that hosts Git repositories and helps teams collaborate.

## 3. Which Git commands did you use most?
I mostly used git status, git add, git commit, git pull, git push, and git fetch.

## 4. What is a repository?
A repository is a storage location that contains project files and their complete version history.

## 5. Difference between git clone and git pull?
git clone creates a local copy of a remote repository for the first time, whereas git pull updates an existing local repository.

## 6. Difference between git fetch and git pull?
git fetch downloads changes without modifying the local code, while git pull downloads and merges the changes.

## 7. What is a branch in Git?
A branch is an independent line of development used to work on features or fixes without affecting the main branch.

## 8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
I identify the conflicting files, resolve the conflicts manually, test the code, and then commit the changes.

## 9. What is git status used for?
git status shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.

## 10. What happens when you run git commit?
git commit saves the staged changes to the local repository with a commit message.
