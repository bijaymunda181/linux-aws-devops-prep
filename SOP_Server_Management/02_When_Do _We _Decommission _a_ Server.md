## When Do We Decommission a Server ?
We decommission a server in the following situations:

- The server has not been used for several months, and the server owner identifies it as unused.

- The application owner confirms that the application is no longer in use and the server can be decommissioned.

- The server is up and running, but no one is using it, or we are unsure whether it is still required.

- The application has already been migrated to another server, and the old server is no longer needed.

Once it is confirmed—either by the application team or the server owner—that the server is not being used, we proceed with the decommissioning process.
